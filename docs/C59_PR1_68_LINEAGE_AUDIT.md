## Closure law

Every PR is represented exactly once. Every channel atom referenced by a PR must exist in the terminal registry. Every registry atom must be referenced by at least one PR. Current exported carriers and byte paths must also occur in the same registry. History is evidence only and cannot create runtime authority.
